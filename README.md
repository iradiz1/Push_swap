# Push Swap

`push_swap` is a sorting algorithm project developed in C as part of a programming curriculum. The goal of the project is to sort a stack of integers using a set of predefined operations with the objective of minimizing the number of moves.

## Features

- **Efficient Sorting Algorithm:** `push_swap` utilizes an efficient sorting algorithm to arrange the integers in the stack with the minimum number of moves.

- **Two Stacks:** The sorting process involves two stacks, denoted as Stack A and Stack B, along with a set of operations to manipulate the stacks.

- **Optimization:** The algorithm is designed to find an optimal solution for sorting the stack, reducing the overall number of moves required.
